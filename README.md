Restaurant Reviews App
---

## Project Overview:

A tiny **Restaurant Reviews** project, which shows some static reviews on selected restaurants. All the required data is contained with in the project.

This app is also offline ready once it serves via the network.

### Motivation

This project has been enhanced/worked upon as part of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program.

### About the app!

Though this app shows reviews of some selected restaurants only, it has some salient features:

1. Uses real map (provided by Mapbox) to show the restaurant location which is useful for route planning.
2. Incorporates responsive design pattern to provide good user experience across the range of devices.
3. Implements offline viewing features so no worries even if the network is gone for a toss.

### Get the app

1. Point your browser to this [GIT HUB](https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/fend5-restaurant-review-app) link and look for 'Clone or download' button to the right of the screen and click Download ZIP button to get the code base to your local.
2. Once done, unzip the file and keep it in any directory you want. Now open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root of project directory.

### What do I do from here?

1. In the root folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and enjoy using the app.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This project uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code.
